<p>I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Pennsylvania. I work with <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~nadiah/">Nadia Heninger</a> in the <a href="http://seclab.upenn.edu/">Security Laboratory</a>, and help to organize the <a href="http://seclab.upenn.edu/reading.html">Security Reading group</a>.</p>

<p> I am broadly interested in applied cryptography, computer security, privacy, elliptic curve cryptography, cryptocurrencies, and distributed systems.</p>
