I am a Systems Engineer on the Cryptography team at Cloudflare. I recently received my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Pennsylvania where I was advised by <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~nadiah/">Nadia Heninger</a>.

<p> I am broadly interested in computer security, applied cryptography, privacy, elliptic curve cryptography, cryptocurrencies, and distributed systems.</p>
